your file system and preview files.

If FILE (a file name) is given:
- if it is a file, preview it in the right window,
- if it is a directory, list it in the child window.

You can only have one `bfs' environment running at a time.

If you call `bfs' with universal argument, `bfs' starts with
the filename of the `current-buffer' in the child window
(see `bfs-child-default').

If you call `bfs' without universal argument, `bfs' starts with
the last file you've visited in the `bfs' environment
(see `bfs-visited' and `bfs-visit').

When you are in the child window (the middle window), you can:
- quit `bfs' environment with `bfs-quit',
- preview files with `bfs-next' and `bfs-previous',
- go up and down in the file system tree with `bfs-backward'
  and `bfs-forward',
- scroll the previewed file with `bfs-scroll-preview-down-half-window',
  `bfs-scroll-preview-up-half-window',
- \"jump\" to any file in your file system with `bfs-find-file', this
  automatically update `bfs' environment.

In the child window, when you move the cursor with functions `isearch-forward'
or `isearch-backward', this will automatically preview the file you
move to.

Any command that invalidates `bfs' environment will cause to leave
`bfs' environment.  See `bfs-check-environment'.

In the child window, the local keymap in use is `bfs-mode-map':
